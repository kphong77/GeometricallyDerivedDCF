# Geometrically-derived Density Compensation Function (gDCF) for Filtered Backprojection and Iterative Reconstruction
**Applications: imaging modalities employing filtered backprojection**
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;1) medical imaging: magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), positron emission tomography (PET), etc.
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;2) non-medical imaging: radar, etc.

*\*Geometrically-derived density compensation function is subject of a US patent application.*
