**Applications: imaging modalities employing filtered backprojection**
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;1) medical imaging: magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), positron emission tomography (PET), etc.
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;2) non-medical imaging: radar, etc.
